# pyauto-gui
Python scripts to practice GUI automation. The code in each script is too specific to the task for which it was designed and must be generalized for broader applications.

Note:
- You may need to install some of the python modules in your machine to run the scripts, to do so, you can use: 
  pip install [ name of the module ]
